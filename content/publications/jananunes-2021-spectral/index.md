abstract: We prove a reciprocity formula for the average of the product of Rankin--Selberg
  $L$-functions $L(1/2,\Pi\times\widetilde\sigma)L(1/2,\sigma\times\widetilde\pi)$ as $\sigma$
  varies over automorphic representations of $\mathrm{PGL}(n)$ over a number field $F$,
  where $\Pi$ and $\pi$ are cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{PGL}(n+1)$
  and $\mathrm{PGL}(n-1)$ over $F$, respectively. If $F$ is totally real, and $\Pi$ and
  $\pi$ are tempered everywhere, we deduce simultaneous non-vanishing of these $L$-values
  for certain sequences of $\sigma$ with conductor tending to infinity in the level
  aspect and bearing certain local conditions.
