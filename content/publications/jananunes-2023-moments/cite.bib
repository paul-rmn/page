 abstract = {We prove an asymptotic formula for the second moment of the \$\mathrm\GL\(n)\times\mathrm\GL\(n+1)\$ Rankin--Selberg central \$L\$-values \$L(1/2,\Pi\otimes\pi)\$, where \$\pi\$ is a fixed cuspidal representation of \$\mathrm\GL\(n)\$ that is tempered and unramified at every place, while \$\Pi\$ varies over a family of automorphic representations of \$\mathrm\PGL\(n+1)\$ ordered by (archimedean or non-archimedean) conductor. As another application of our method, we prove the existence of infinitely many cuspidal representations \$\Pi\$ of \$\mathrm\PGL\(n+1)\$ such that \$L(1/2,\Pi\otimes\pi_1)\$ and \$L(1/2,\Pi\otimes\pi_2)\$ do not vanish simultaneously where \$\pi_1\$ and \$\pi_2\$ are cuspidal representations of \$\mathrm\GL\(n)\$ that are unramified and tempered at every place and have trivial central characters.},
